Q3 FINAL SPRINT WEB DEV

Overview
Objective: Create a JSON file, read its contents using JavaScript, and display the data in the browser console and as HTML.
Tools: Visual Studio Code, JavaScript, HTML, JSON.
Output: Demonstrate understanding of JavaScript basics by managing JSON data and displaying it on a web page.
Steps to Complete the Project
Setup HTML and JavaScript Files

Create an HTML file and a linked JavaScript file in Visual Studio Code.
Use the <script> tag in the HTML file to link the JavaScript file.
Test the connection by using console.log() to print a message in the browser's console.
Create a JSON File

Write a JSON file with at least five records, each containing various data types (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans).
Save the JSON file in the same directory as your HTML and JavaScript files.
Read JSON File Using Fetch API

Use the Fetch API in JavaScript to read the JSON file.
Ensure the server is serving the JSON file correctly (this might require using a simple HTTP server).
Iterate Over JSON Data

Use a forEach loop in JavaScript to iterate over the records in the JSON file.
Log one key-value pair from each record to the console to verify that reading is successful.
Create Functions to Process JSON Data

Write three JavaScript functions that return formatted strings describing the contents of the JSON file.
Display these results as HTML elements on the web page.
Display Data in the Browser

Use JavaScript to write the contents of the JSON file to the browser window as HTML.
Also, ensure that the JSON data is written to the console for verification.
Learning Outcomes
Ability to create, read, and display JSON data using JavaScript.
Understanding of linking JavaScript files to HTML pages.
Proficiency in using the Fetch API to retrieve and process JSON data.
Capability to iterate over JSON records and display data using JavaScript functions.
Project Deliverables
GitHub Repository: Upload all project files, including the HTML, JavaScript, and JSON files, to a personal GitHub repository.
Submission: Submit the GitHub repository URL for marking via the assignment portal.
Additional Tips
Ensure all files are correctly linked and paths are properly set.
Test your project in different browsers to ensure compatibility.
Use comments in your code for clarity and documentation.
Use console logs effectively for debugging and testing purposes.
This project will enhance your understanding of JavaScript's interaction with JSON data and demonstrate your ability to implement basic web development skills.
